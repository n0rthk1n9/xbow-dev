            I tried to download the App Exhibit App onto my device but it didn't
            work, what should I do?
          </strong>
          <p>If you have problems downloading App Exhibit here are some tips:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Check how much storage you have left on your iPhone / iPad:</li>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Tap on <strong>Settings</strong> on your home screen and after
                that on <strong>General</strong>
              </li>
              <li>Tap on iPhone / iPad Storage</li>
            </ol>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If there is less than 100 MB of space available you can try deleting
            other apps to free up some space. After that just try to download
            App Exhibit again.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>

              connect to a Wifi Network and start the download of App Exhibit
              again.
            </li>
